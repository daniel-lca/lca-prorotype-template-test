# 04 — Prototype system

> **In this template:** the registry, Prototype Home, and flow navigation already exist in `src/prototype/`.
> Prototype Home lives at `/`. See the "In this template" table in `05-prototype-schema.md`.

## 1. Purpose

Every prototype project must provide a navigable overview of the work that has been created.

The system has three goals:

1. Make it easy for stakeholders to understand the available user journeys.
2. Make it easy for designers and developers to find every prototype screen.
3. Make it difficult for AI-generated work to become disconnected, duplicated, or forgotten.

The prototype is therefore both:

- an interactive product prototype
- a structured documentation layer for the prototype itself

---

## 2. Required Prototype Home

Every project must have a Prototype Home page.

The exact visual design may adapt to the project's design language, but the information architecture must contain the following areas.

### A. Prototype Flows

A high-level view of complete user journeys.

Flows must be grouped by **user type**.

Each flow entry should show enough information to understand what it contains without opening it.

Recommended content:

- flow name
- short description
- user type
- number of steps/screens
- ordered step names or a concise flow preview
- status when useful
- `Open Flow` action

`Open Flow` must open the defined first screen of that flow.

A flow must never point to an arbitrary screen simply because that route currently exists.

### B. All Prototype Screens

A complete index of prototype screens.

Hierarchy:

`User Type → Flow → Screen`

Each flow group should include:

- flow title
- short explanation
- ordered screens
- step numbers when the flow is sequential
- direct link to each screen
- direct `Open Flow` action when useful

This section is the exhaustive prototype inventory.

If a screen exists in the prototype and belongs to a flow, it must appear here.

### C. Developer Shortcuts

Optional but recommended for larger prototypes.

Shortcuts may include:

- direct links to frequently tested screens
- edge cases
- alternate states
- error states
- empty states
- loading states
- modal/drawer examples
- role-specific entry points

Developer shortcuts must reference the same registered screens. They must not create a second screen catalog.

---

## 3. One Source of Truth

Prototype Flows and All Prototype Screens are two views of the same underlying prototype structure.

They must never be authored as separate manual datasets.

A central prototype registry must define the prototype structure.

Conceptually:

```text
Prototype Registry
│
├── User Types
│
├── Flows
│   ├── Flow metadata
│   └── Ordered screen references
│
└── Screens
    ├── Screen metadata
    ├── Route
    └── Flow relationship
        │
        ├──────────────► Prototype Flows
        ├──────────────► All Prototype Screens
        ├──────────────► Dev Shortcuts
        └──────────────► Prototype Navigation
```

The implementation technology is flexible.

The architecture is not.

---

## 4. Required Relationships

Every normal prototype screen must know:

- which user type it belongs to
- which flow it belongs to
- its unique identifier
- its route
- its display name
- its position in the flow

Every flow must know:

- its unique identifier
- its user type
- its display name
- its description
- its ordered screens
- its starting screen

A screen should not independently store an order that conflicts with the order defined by its flow.

Choose one authoritative ordering mechanism and use it consistently.

---

## 5. Flow Behavior

A flow represents a meaningful user journey, not merely a visual category.

Good examples:

- Account Creation
- Create Project
- Submit Application
- Compare Offers
- Complete Purchase
- Review Request
- Manage Subscription

Poor examples:

- Forms
- Cards
- Random Screens
- New Screens
- Miscellaneous

Screens should be grouped by what the user is trying to accomplish.

---

## 6. Flow Entry and Navigation

Every flow must have an explicit starting screen.

When `Open Flow` is triggered:

1. open the defined start screen
2. preserve the correct user context
3. allow the prototype to continue through the intended sequence

When a screen is opened directly from All Prototype Screens:

- open exactly that screen
- do not force the user back to the beginning of the flow

Direct links must be stable whenever possible.

---

## 7. Screen States

A screen may have multiple important states.

Examples:

- default
- empty
- loading
- success
- validation error
- permission denied
- locked
- disabled
- completed
- canceled

Not every state needs to become a separate top-level screen.

Use this rule:

Create a separate registered screen/state when the state is important enough that a stakeholder or developer should be able to open it directly.

Minor interaction states can remain inside the main screen implementation.

---

## 8. Status

Prototype metadata may optionally support status values such as:

- planned
- draft
- in progress
- ready for review
- approved
- deprecated

Status should support understanding, not add maintenance overhead.

Do not create complex status systems unless the project needs them.

---

## 9. Scalability

The structure must continue to work when a project grows from:

- 5 screens to 100+ screens
- 1 user type to several user types
- a few flows to many flows

Do not design Prototype Home as a hardcoded showcase page that becomes unmanageable later.

Use reusable grouping, filtering, searching, or collapsing when scale requires it.

---

## 10. Principle of Completion

Creating the visual screen is only one part of creating a prototype screen.

A prototype task is complete only when:

- the screen exists
- the route works
- the registry is correct
- the flow is correct
- Prototype Flows is correct
- All Prototype Screens is correct
- navigation is correct
- related prototype metadata is correct


## All Prototype Screens: visual gallery requirement

All Prototype Screens must be a complete visual gallery of rendered prototype interfaces, shown side by side within each flow. A text list, table, route directory, or cards containing only names and descriptions does not satisfy this requirement.

Render every preview from the same registered React component used by its interactive route. Do not create separately maintained mock screens, hand-built thumbnails, static screenshots, or generic placeholders in place of the interface. Each preview has the step number and screen name above it, plus an explicit, accessible `Open Screen` link.

Group previews by user type and flow and arrange them in a responsive grid: show multiple screens side by side on desktop and reduce columns on narrow viewports while preserving legibility. Keep the intended viewport and aspect ratio when scaling. Do not force a desktop interface to reflow as mobile just to fit a gallery cell. Exclude FlowBar and Prototype Home tooling from previews, while preserving product styling inside them.

Previews use deterministic demo data and show their intended state without requiring earlier steps. They are static for review: viewing or mounting them must not navigate, submit forms, mutate shared product state, or make external requests. Their embedded controls must be inert and excluded from keyboard focus; the external `Open Screen` link opens the interactive version.

Registered variants such as error, empty, modal, and drawer states must appear as rendered previews beside their parent, labeled with the parent step and state. They do not add journey steps or alter `screenIds`. Standalone utility screens appear in their own visual group. Derive membership, labels, order, links, and counts from the existing registry; do not create a parallel catalog.

The starter `PrototypeHome.tsx` uses a textual `ScreenRow` list. When product screens are built, replace that presentation with a reusable preview gallery while preserving the registry, routes, Prototype Flows, and navigation.
