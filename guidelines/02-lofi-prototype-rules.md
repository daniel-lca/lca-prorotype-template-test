# 02 — Lo-fi prototype rules

The prototype exists to validate **structure and flow**. Visual polish is out of scope.

These rules cover the **Lo-fi** and **Lo-fi+** fidelity levels. If the brief says **Mid-fi (Memorisely)**, the
"Visual" section below is replaced by the visual files in `guidelines/design-system/` (color, radius, icons,
motion, light/dark). Content, Behavior, Breakpoints, and Wireframe notes still apply at every fidelity, and so do
the behavior files in `guidelines/design-system/` (accessibility, interactions, system status, progressive
disclosure, responsive).

## Visual

- **Grayscale only.** Use Tailwind `neutral-*` shades. The one exception: if the brief says
  "Lo-fi+", allow a single accent color for primary buttons and active states.
- **System font stack** (Tailwind default `font-sans`). No custom fonts, no icon fonts.
- **Images = placeholder boxes**: a gray box with a diagonal cross or a label like `[Hero image]`.
  Use the `Placeholder` component in `src/components/Placeholder.tsx`. No stock photos, no generated images.
- **Icons**: simple gray circles/squares or text labels. Only add an icon library if the user asks.
- Borders, spacing, and hierarchy do the work: 1px `neutral-300` borders, clear headings, generous whitespace.
- No gradients, shadows beyond `shadow-sm`, animations, or illustrations.

## Content

- Use **realistic placeholder copy** that matches the product (real-sounding names, labels, numbers).
  Lorem ipsum is only acceptable for long body text.
- Keep mock data in `src/data/` as typed arrays, so screens stay consistent with each other.

## Behavior

- **Every core flow must be clickable end to end.** Buttons and links in a flow must navigate.
- **Every screen is registered** in `src/prototype/registry.ts` (see `04-prototype-system.md`). In-screen
  buttons navigate with the target screen's registered route; never hardcode a route that is not in the registry.
- Forms: fields are interactive, submit goes to the next step. No real validation beyond "required".
- Elements outside the core flows can be inert; give them `title="Not in prototype"`.
- No backend, no auth provider, no database. Fake login = a button that navigates.
- **Do not call the Gemini API or any external API** unless the brief explicitly asks for an AI feature.

## Breakpoints (from the brief)

| Brief answer | What to do |
|---|---|
| Responsive | Mobile-first. Check at 390px, 768px, 1280px. Nav collapses on mobile. |
| Desktop only | Build for 1440px wide, min width 1280px. No mobile layout. |
| Mobile only | Build at 390px. On wider screens, center the app inside a phone frame (`PhoneFrame` component). Prototype Home stays full width, outside the frame. |
| Mobile + desktop | Two layouts: under 768px and 1024px and above. Tablet can use the desktop layout. |

## Wireframe notes (optional)

When a screen needs an explanation for reviewers ("this table will be paginated", "data comes from CRM"),
use the `Note` component in `src/components/Note.tsx`. It renders a yellow sticky-note callout.
This is the only non-gray element allowed.

## Prototype tooling

Prototype Home (`/`) and the flow bar above each screen are tooling, not product. They stay grayscale at every
fidelity. Do not restyle them to match the product, and do not remove them. Reviewers can hide the flow bar with
its **Hide** button during a demo.
